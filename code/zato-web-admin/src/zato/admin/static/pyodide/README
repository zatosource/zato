Pyodide installation:

Download pyodide-core-x.x.x.tar.bz2 from github releases page [https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases] and decompress to your chosen directory:
Example: `wget -qO- https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases/download/0.27.3/pyodide-core-0.27.3.tar.bz2 | tar -xvjf - -C ./code/zato-web-admin/src/zato/admin/static`

Notes:
You'll see a difference in the time it takes Pyodide to load in Firefox vs Chrome, I think this is because Chrome supports caching webassembly code.

There are multiple ways to load your application code into the Pyodide filesystem. The following two methods are detailed in this demo:
- Loading files manually through pyodide.FS:
    This involves creating individual directories and files to mirror your application code structure in the Pyodide instance.
- Building a wheel/archive of your application code and installing it with Pyodide:
    Once built, the archive can be loaded directly into Pyodide
    - Example: `python3 -m build`
