Statistics guide
================

Zato's :ref:`service statistics  <stats-guide-service-statistics>` allow one to observe
trends in behaviour of services deployed
on servers and to compare historical data in order to find weak spots and first
symptoms of a misbehaving service. 

They're meant to be an aid for developers and administrators more than a strategical
tool for making long-term decisions.

Another group of statistics are these :doc:`produced by the load-balancer <./lb>`, concerning
its current state - how many servers are up, whether there were any downtimes,
how many clients are connected and more.

.. _stats-guide-service-statistics:

Service statistics
------------------

Each execution of any service prompts Zato to store certain statistics in the Redis
broker:

* Which service has been invoked and when it was
* How long it took for the service to complete
* :ref:`CID <progguide-write-service-cid>` the service has been invoked with

Zato's own 
`internal (look up stats_jobs) <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-server/src/zato/server/spring_context.py>`_
:doc:`scheduler's jobs <../progguide/scheduler>` aggregate raw information
into higher-order structures, all stored in Redis too - per minute stats are
converted into per hour status, these get aggregated into per day information and so
on until a summary information concerning each year has been constructed.

Note that the lowest level data that has been already aggregated is left in Redis and, unless it's 
needed, :doc:`must be cleaned up manually or using a custom job <./maintenance>`
in order to avoid an unnecessary growth of Redis.

Trends and summaries
--------------------

Trends are summaries are used to get an understanding of which services are the
slowest ones and which ones are the most commonly used.

   :alt:
   
The difference between the two is that trends charts are generated on fly
and they're a heavy-weight operation. Trends should not be used for checking 
more than just a few hours worth of data.

Summaries are pre-computed, have no charts, and can span aribitrary datetime
ranges, hours, days, months or even years.

.. warning ::

  Again, note that you shouldn't use trends for displaying more than a few hours
  of statistics - doing so is a very intensive operation which effectively works
  as a DoS attack which needs restarting a server.

Understanding the inteface
--------------------------

   :alt:
   :scale: 50%

* Both trends and summaries present a unified inteface with the whole exception
  being that summaries have no charts
  
* Statistics can always be downloaded in CSV
  
* There are always at least two groups of statistics. If a side-by-side
  comparison has been choosen, there are also two groups of relevant statistics
  for the time period to compare with.
  
  Each column in each group can be clicked to make the stats sorted by the column.
  
  Hovering over a row highlights the same service in other groups.
  
  All statistics always deal with the given time period selected only - for
  summaries this can be arbitrarily long.

Attention grabbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. image:: /gfx/stats/attention.png
   :alt:
   
It is possible to :ref:`set <stats-guide-settings>` that special attention grabbers
be displayed to the left of each service if:

* Response time is greater than a threshold specified (for trends)
* Usage share is greater than a percentage specified (for summaries)

.. _stats-guide-settings:

Settings
--------

.. image:: /gfx/stats/settings.png
   :alt:
   :scale: 50%
   
scheduler -> How often to process raw statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How often to invoke a background job to turn raw statistics into per-minute
statistics - default value lets some statistics be gathered in Redis before
they're aggregated.

The value should take into account how long it will take to process a single 
batch of statistics and how big the batch will be (next setting).

scheduler -> At most, how many raw statistics to process in one batch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a background job starts to aggregate raw statistics, it will fetch at
most that many raw data items from Redis.

This should be set in conjunction with the previous settings - proper values should
take into account how many requests a second Zato processes.

For instance, if:

* How often to process raw statistics is 120
* How often to process raw statistics is 90000
* 90000 / 120 = 750 req/s
* This is the upper limit of raw data stored that Zato will make use of - 
  if now the platform starts processing 900 req/s any additional requests
  will be ignored and the statistics will be incorrect.
  
The value should take into account how often the batches are fetched (previous setting)
as processing of the previous batch should complete before a new one is started.

scheduler -> How often to aggregate per-minute statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How often to fetch per-minute statistics and turn them into statistics for
each hour, day, month and so on. Should be no less than 60.

Attention grabbers -> Slow service threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an average response time in less than this value, an attention grabber will
be displayed to the left of the service name in trends.

Attention grabbers -> Top service usage threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a given service's usage share is more than this value, an attention grabber will
be displayed to the left of the service name in summaries.
