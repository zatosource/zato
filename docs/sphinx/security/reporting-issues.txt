Reporting security issues
=========================

Any security issues will be given top priority. Please be responsible and
give the project a chance to fix them before you disclose anything in public
forums or lists.

Send an email explaining the situation to security@zato.io with a subject line of
"Security report". This is an address only trusted developers have access to.

You are encouraged to use this 
`PGP key for contacting the developers securely <https://zato.io/support/zato-security.pgp.asc>`_,
the key’s fingerprint is E4C58D88.

Within 72 hours you will be notified of its reception and we will work with you
through e-mail and other means on resolving the issue.

Once the situation will have been contained, a fix will be released, fully crediting
you as the reporter of the issue.

Again, please, do not disclose anything publicly without contacting the project
first. We are as much interested in a more secure world as you are.
