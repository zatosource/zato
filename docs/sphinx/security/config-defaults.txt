Default configuration values
============================

Overview
--------

This chapter lists security-related default configuration values for each of the Zato
components. 

.. note::

  In short, **there are no default passwords in Zato** although the crypto
  material isn't password-protected by default.


Certificate Authority (CA)
--------------------------

* Default password of a CA is stored in ./ca-material/ca-password and is a randomly
  generated UUID4. The file is not encrypted.

Load-balancer
-------------

* A load-balancer agent's doesn't by default validate client certificates,
  the value of ./config/repo/lb-agent.conf's verify_fields is {}
  
* A load-balancer allows for users to access its statistics at /zato-lb-stats,
  the default user is admin1 and its default password, stored in ./config/repo/zato.config,
  is a randomly generated UUID4

Redis KVDB
----------

Visit `Redis documentation <http://redis.io/>`_ for more information regarding its default configuration.

Servers
-------

* For AMQP definitions and outgoing SQL connections as well as for
  HTTP Basic Auth, WS-Security and technical account security definitions,
  right after they have been created their password is a randomly generated UUID4
  stored in clear text in the SQL ODB.
  
* Each server stores a part of its configuration in an INI-style file located in ./config/repo/server.conf

  * odb:username is zato1 by default
  * odb:password and kvdb:password are randomly generated UUID4s encrypted with a mechanism
    used by the :doc:`zato encrypt </admin/cli/encrypt>` command
  * misc:internal_services_may_be_deleted is False - meaning this server won't
    allow for internal services to be deleted through its :doc:`API </public-api/intro>`.

SQL ODB
-------

Visit your SQL database's home page for more information regarding its default configuration.

* `Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html>`_
* `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org>`_

Web admin
---------

* For AMQP definitions and outgoing SQL connections as well as for
  HTTP Basic Auth, WS-Security and technical account security definitions,
  right after they have been created their password is a randomly generated UUID4
  stored in clear text in the SQL ODB.
  
* Right after a web admin's user has been created, its password is a randomly
  generated UUID4 stored in clear text in the SQL ODB. It can be changed using
  the :doc:`zato update password </admin/cli/update-crypto>` command.
