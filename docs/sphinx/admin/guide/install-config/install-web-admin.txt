Installing a web admin console
==============================

Steps
-----

* Make sure `Redis <http://redis.io>`_ is installed and allows for future Zato servers to connect,
  e.g. a user for Zato has been added
* :doc:`Install an ODB <./install-odb>`
* :doc:`Install a cluster's config <./install-cluster>`
* Prepare crypto material, in PEM, with no passwords, for web admin to use:

  * Public key
  * Private key
  * Certificate
  * A list of CA certificates web admin can trust
  
  Note that Zato ships with :doc:`a simple CA <../../cli/ca>` 
  that can be used on development environments.
  
* Issue the :doc:`zato create web_admin <../../cli/create-web-admin>` command

.. note ::

  A single web admin console is able to manage multiple clusters.
