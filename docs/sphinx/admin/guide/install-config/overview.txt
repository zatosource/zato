Installing and configuring Zato components
==========================================

.. note ::

  Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the
  :doc:`high-level overview <../../../intro/overview-high-level>`
  and
  :doc:`the technical one <../../../intro/overview-tech>`
  as well with 
  :doc:`Zato's architecture <../../../architecture/overview>`,
  :doc:`OS-level and application users <../../../security/users>`
  and 
  :doc:`the attack surface <../../../security/attack-surface>`
  before you start to install and configure Zato components.
  
  It's also highly recommeded that you :doc:`go through the tutorial first <../../../tutorial/01>`.

Overview
--------

* Each Zato environment is comprised of one or more clusters
* Clusters store their configuration in an SQL ODB
* Each cluster has a load-balancer
* A web admin console is needed to manage a cluster however a single web admin instance can be used
  to administer more than one cluster
* Each cluster has zero or more servers
* Incoming and outgoing connections are handled by servers and certain types of
  protocols - AMQP, JMS WebSphere MQ and ZeroMQ - require separate connector
  processes to handle the traffic. The connectors are started
  and managed automatically, they don't need manual configuration.

.. note ::

  Cluster is a logical being - its mere physical manifestation is that it has
  its own configuration in the ODB. However, servers, web-admin, load-balancer,
  connectors are all components that actually start operating system-level processes,
  write out log entries and otherwise behave like objects that need to be administered.

Creating a new environment
--------------------------

To set up a completely new Zato environment you need to:

* Make sure Redis 2.1.3+ is installed and configured to allow access for Zato
* Ensure an SQL database is installed and a schema/username for Zato is created.
  Supported databases are:

  * PostgreSQL 9.x
  * Oracle 11.2.x
  
* Make a new cluster by:

  * Using a :doc:`a quickstart cluster <../../cli/quickstart>`
  * Manually creating each of the components needed:
    
    * SQL ODB
    * Cluster's config
    * Web admin
    * Load-balancer
    * Servers
    
    SQL ODB and a cluster's config need to me be created first and in that order,
    the rest can be installed in any order.

.. _admin-guide-install-config-versioned:

Config files are versioned
--------------------------

A history of changes to any config file is automatically kept in a given component's
`Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ repository, i.e. in the ./config/repo directory.

This allows to compare different config versions or to revert to a safe state
after a mix-up.

The repository is created and managed completely behind the scenes and needs no
manual management however it's worth pointing out that it contains the whole history
of a given config file, possibly including any old secrets, such as passwords.
