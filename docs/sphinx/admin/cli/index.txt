Command line interface (CLI)
============================

Introduction
------------

Zato administrators use both the web admin and the command line interface (CLI)
to manage Zato environments. These two methods don't overlap, both have their
distinct responsibilites.

While the web admin has been created with the goal
of aiding in running an already existing environment, the CLI has been created
with the goal of preparing Zato environments or otherwise addressing situations that
need access to an operating system Zato components are installed on.

Commands offered by the CLI always need an actual access to the file system via,
for instance, ssh. They can't be issued remotely through the web admin.

All commands are run using a single executable called **zato**.

Some commands are further composed of subcommands, e.g. the :doc:`zato update<./update>` command
is a wrapper for more specific commands, such as :doc:`zato update crypto<./update-crypto>`
and :doc:`zato update password<./update-password>`.

Commands can be run in a batch mode by using the combination of the 
:ref:`--store-config<cli_index_common_options>` option and the :doc:`from-config<from-config>` command.
