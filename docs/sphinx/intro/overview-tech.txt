Zato clusters
-------------


Each Zato environment is comprised of one or more Zato clusters that allow for
the messages passing through to be handled in a secure and reliable way.

A cluster has :doc:`a high-availability load balancer <../architecture/load-balancer>` in front of the message processing servers.
External applications connect to the load balancer which distributes the load across one or more
servers according to the configured algorithm, with round-robin being the default
one.


The load balancer is smart enough to realize, in case of a failure, whether a server
has gone down, and stops forwarding messages to it. Conversly, when a server comes up,
the load balancer automatically recognizes it and starts dispatching requests.
There is no limit to the number of servers in a cluster and administrators
have the ability to take servers offline or online without disrupting message processing.

Zato's HA load balancer is implemented on top of
`HAProxy <http://haproxy.1wt.eu/>`_. :doc:`(read more) <../architecture/load-balancer>`

A :doc:`Zato server <../architecture/servers>` is the entity that does the job of exposing
services to external applications and does the processing of incoming requests.
Servers are also capable of invoking other external applications through various
protocols and formats.  

Exactly one of the servers in a given cluster
has also a highly-customizable built-in scheduler which can be configured to
fire background jobs. Zato servers always contain identical copies of services,
they're always symmetrical and run the same code under a common configuration.

:doc:`Web admin <../architecture/web-admin>` is a slick AJAX web-based administration console used for the management of clusters.
Each cluster has one web admin console although a single console may be reused
for managing multiple clusters. Web admin is implemented in
`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
with a pinch of of `jQuery <http://jquery.com/>`_ added in for frontend features.

:doc:`ODB (Operational database) <../architecture/sql-odb>` is an SQL database used for storing static
configuration common to all members of the cluster. ODB may be installed on
`Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/index.html>`_ or
`PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_.

Redis is used to store the more dynamic configuration and to provide quick
access to Zato statistics. :doc:`(read more) <../stats/guide>`

Implementation overview
-------------------------------

Zato is mostly implemented in Python. Many of its core dependencies are implemented in Python,
C and in `Cython <http://cython.org>`_. In particular, all the heavy processing of XML and JSON documents is always
performed by libraries written in C.

Zato servers are running on top of `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_, in the asynchronous `gevent <http://gevent.org>`_ 
mode by default. This allows Zato to easily handle thousands of incoming connections. Processing hundreds or thousands messages
a second is easily within Zato's reach.

Programmers use `Python <http://python.org>`_ to develop services. Python is a very high-level and
powerful programming language, famously known for its ease of use and readibility, both of which greatly reduce
the Zato services' maintenance costs.
