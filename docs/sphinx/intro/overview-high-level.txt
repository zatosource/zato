High-level overview
====================


The three-layer architecture
============================

In the classical three-layer architecture of fronted, middleware and backend
processes, Zato is best suited at the middle or far backend of your IT
infrastructure.

Areas where Zato shines are business integration - such as implementing an `Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)`_, 
and core services - billing, customer management,
purchase processing, supporting marketing campaings, core banking and many
similar activities that form a backbone of an enterprise.

Zato can serve as either an ESB or an application server and a successful implementation
of a Zato environment allows for:

* aiding in introducing and optimizing complex business processes
* creating software solutions in less time
* connecting dispersed applications
* enabling the communication between systems with incompatible interfaces
* unifying access methods to independent applications
* introducing a common security model across different parts of the IT infrastructure

Zato environments are composed of clusters, each of which is a set of servers
and supporting applications running in a :doc:`HA<../admin/guide/ha>` configuration.

Message processing
==================

At its very core, the Zato's production ready processing capabilities allow you
to:

* create reusable services
* transform messages between different formats
* orchestrate the services of multiple autonomous systems
* send and receive messages between multiple transport protocols available, using either
  synchronous or asynchronous methods
* log, audit and monitor messages flowing through the platform
* validate the messages according to certain business rules
* enrich the messages from different sources
* queue the messages if the applications involved within the integration scenarios run at
  different processing speeds
* implement services in less time using `Python`_, a very high-level programming language
  that promotes ease of use and development speed. A Hello World
  service is shown below. Such a service can be hot-deployed onto a cluster
  without a need to restart servers.
  
  :: 
  
      from zato.server.service import Service
      
      class HelloWorld(Service):
          def handle(self):
              self.response.payload = 'How goes it?'

Interfaces
==========

Various interfaces that Zato can access allow one for reaching out to any application,
regardless of its origin and programming language used. The interfaces include:

* the ubiquitous HTTP(S) protocol
* FTP(S)
* AMQP
* WebSphere MQ
* ZeroMQ
* JMS
* REST
* SOAP
* SQL

Web admin
=========

Zato has a slick and powerful web admin application for administrator to manage
the environments. Web admin allows one to perform routine, planned as well as
ad-hoc activities, such as deploying services, configuring security, access channels,
browsing the messages and more.

Zato, the open-source project
=============================

Zato is open-source software licensed under a commercial-friendly `LGPL`_ license and is not only
code proper but also an open-source project promoting open collaboration through
peer production and the exchange of ideas between developers
and users. :doc:`Everyone is strongly encouraged to take part in the project<../project/get-involved>`
and help build better world through nicer, faster, easier and more reliable software!
