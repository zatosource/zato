Key/value database (Redis) - remote commands
==============================================

Overview
--------

* Menu path: Key/value DB -> Remote commands
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/kvdb/remote-command/?cluster=1

A form is provided to run Redis commands directly from the browser. This can be
used to debug, administer, manage, list, delete, add Redis keys or to perform any
other action the database supports.

The string (None) is returned if a given command doesn't produce any output.
Otherwise the response is dumped into a string and displayed in the textarea.
