Securing access to the web admin panel
======================================

When you attempt to visit a web admin instance, such as the one on
http://localhost:8183/, you are greeted with a login box which requires
you to present a username and its accompanying password.

The credentials can be added and updated using the command line.

* To add a new user account use the :doc:`zato create user <../admin/cli/create-user>` command, 
  e.g.:
  
  ::
  
   $ zato create user /opt/zato/dev1/web-admin
   Username (Leave blank to use 'user'): ohara
   E-mail address: ohara@example.com
   Password: 
   Password (again): 
   OK
   $
   
* To update a password use the :doc:`zato update password <../admin/cli/update-password>` command, 
  e.g.:
  
  ::
  
    $ zato update password /opt/zato/dev1/web-admin ohara
    Changing password for user 'ohara'
    Password: 
    Password (again): 
    OK
    $


.. note ::
   There are no roles nor user groups, every user is treated equally. There is no
   way to delete a user - set its password to a random string if you'd like to
   block the access. 
   
   Future Zato versions will certainly add a lot in this area.
