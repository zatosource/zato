Channels - ZeroMQ
==================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through ZeroMQ channels.

Each channels represents a connection through which ZeroMQ messages are 
received by Zato. A given service is invoked for each message received.

Creating or updating a channel (re-)establishes a connection to a ZeroMQ socket
and there are as many connectors and connections to any socket as there are 
active channels connected to it. 

For instance, if there are 5 channels to a socket, there will
be 5 connector processes started in a cluster each maintaining 1 connection
to the socket pointed to by the channel.

Reading messages off a socket and invoking a service is an asynchronous
activity - messages are not rolled back onto sockets if there are any errors
along.

Name                Channel name
Active              :ref:`Documented below <web-admin-channels-zmq-active>`
Address             Address of a ZeroMQ socket to connect to. Must start
                    with tcp://
Socket type         Type of a socket to connect to. Either PULL or SUB.
Subscription key    *(Optional and ignored if socket type is not SUB)*
                    Consumer's subscription key
Service             Name of an already existing service to invoke for
                    each ZeroMQ message received
Data format         *(Optional)* The expected data format Zato should parse
                    incoming messages as. This will also populate a service's
                    :ref:`data_format attribute <progguide-write-service-data_format>`.

Delete
------

Stops a channel's connector and deletes the channel from ODB.

The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If a channel is made inactive, its underlying ZeroMQ connection will be stopped
but the connector itself will be still running.
