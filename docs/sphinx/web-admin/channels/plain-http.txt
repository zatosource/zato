Channels - Plain HTTP
=====================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through plain HTTP channels.

A plain HTTP channels is a means of accepting synchronous HTTP service invocations.
Contrary to what :doc:`SOAP channels <./soap>` assume, plain HTTP ones don't except
the data to be in any particular format, it can be anything that can be
transfered over HTTP, including JSON, CSV, XML or virtually anything.

Header              Notes
=================== ===================================================================
Name                Channel name
Active              :ref:`Documented below <web-admin-channels-plain-http-active>`
URL path            A path to mount this channel on. Must be unique in a cluster.
Method              *(Optional)* An HTTP method that must be used by clients to invoke
                    this particular channel. It can be any string and Zato won't check
                    if it's a valid HTTP 1.1 method. Leave empty to allow any method
                    be used.
Service             Name of an already existing service to invoke for
                    each HTTP request received
Data format         *(Optional)* The expected data format Zato should parse
                    incoming messages as. This will also populate a service's
                    :ref:`data_format attribute <progguide-write-service-data_format>`.
Security            Name of a security definition - 
                    :doc:`HTTP Basic Auth <../security/basic-auth>`,
                    :doc:`technical account <../security/tech-account>`
                    or a 
                    :doc:`WS-Security <../security/ws-security>` definition
                    - to use for securing the access to the channel. 
                    
                    Pick 'No security' explicitly to indicate that no such definition
                    should be used.  This can be used to expose certain services 
                    without any 
                    usernames or to indicate that a service will implement a custom
                    security scheme itself.

Delete
------

Deletes the channel from ODB and servers. The channel won't exist anymore and invoking
a URL it was mounted on will return HTTP 404 error.

.. _web-admin-channels-plain-http-active:
  
The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If a channel is made inactive, an attempt to invoke it will result in an HTTP
404 error.
