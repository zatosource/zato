Channels - JMS WebSphere MQ
===========================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through JMS WebSphere MQ channels.

Each channels represents a connection through which MQ messages are 
received by Zato. A given service is invoked for each message received.

Creating or updating a channel (re-)establishes a connection to an MQ queue manager
and there are as many connectors and connections to any broker as there are 
active channels  connected to it. 

For instance, if there is 1 
:doc:`JMS WebSphere MQ definition <../conn-def/jms-wmq>` and 5 channels using it, there will
be 5 connector processes started in a cluster each maintaining 1 connection
to the broker pointed to by the definition.

Reading messages off a queue and invoking a service is an asynchronous
activity - messages are not rolled back onto queues if there are any errors
along.

Delete
------

Stops a channel's connector and deletes the channel from ODB.

The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If a channel is made inactive, its underlying MQ connection
will be stopped but the connector itself will be still running.
