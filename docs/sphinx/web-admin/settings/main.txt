Clicking 'My settings' allows you to update:

* Your timezone and preffered date/time format. This will be used throughout
  the whole of the web admin except for a few places that are explicitly 
  documented to use UTC.
  
* Cluster color markers - a feature that lets you easily tell one cluster from
  another which is documented in :doc:`its own chapter <../../progguide/web-admin-settings>`.
