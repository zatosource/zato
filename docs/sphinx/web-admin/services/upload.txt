Uploading a service
===================

Overview
--------

Hot-deploys one or more services to a cluster. All servers are updated automatically.
If any service already exists, it will be replaced. Currently running instances
of a service will not be stopped.

* Menu path: Services -> (choose a cluster and click 'Upload a service package' below the search form)
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/service/?cluster=1&name_filter=stats

Uploading services is an asynchronous process - always check the server logs
to find out if everything went fine. For each server, there must be as many
confirmations of  a successful deployment in server logs as there are
:doc:`main.gunicorn_workers<../../admin/guide/install-config/config-server>` configured.

  Only flat Python modules can be hot-deployed -
