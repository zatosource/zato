How to add a server to the load-balancer
----------------------------------------

* Make sure it's been :doc:`installed and started <../../admin/guide/install-config/install-server>`
* Click 'Add to LB' - this will add it to LB's config and hot-reload the latter's config
* Navigate to
  :doc:`GUI <../load-balancer/gui>`
  or
  :doc:`source code view <../load-balancer/source-code>`
  and fix its port so it doesn't read 123456
  
  This step is needed because servers don't store port they listen on anywhere
  except in
  :doc:`their config files <../../admin/guide/install-config/config-server>`
  so the LB doesn't access have access to such information in
  the previous step - it needs to be provided manually by an admin.
  
.. note ::

  Future Zato versions will automate the process and the manual update won't
  be needed.
  
How to remove a server from the load-balancer's config
------------------------------------------------------

* This can be done only if a server has been previously added to the LB
* Click 'Remove from LB' - this will remove it from LB's config and hot-reload the latter's config

How to delete a server from the ODB
-----------------------------------

* :doc:`Stop the server <../../admin/cli/stop>`
* Remove it from LB's config
* Click 'Delete' - this will delete it completely from the ODB, cascading to
  any related SQL data
  
.. note ::

  A server cannot delete itself.
