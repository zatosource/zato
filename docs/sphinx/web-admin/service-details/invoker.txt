Data format choosen will populate a service instance's
:ref:`data_format <progguide-write-service-data_format>` attribute
while transport will make Zato understand it needs to parse the request 
out of an envelope, if any.

Note that if you select a data format and transport you need to make sure the input
data actually conforms to it.
