Service details - Sample requests/responses
===========================================

Overview
--------

Lets one specify that 1 in N invocations of a service should store its request
and response for a later use.

For instance, 1 in 10,000 invocations could serve as a usage example.

By default, requests and responses are displayed as they were accepted/produced
by a service - toggling pretty print on and off makes them be shown in a 
human-readable form or otherwise, assuming they're either JSON or XML.

Note that only the payload a service received or produced is returned - without any
transport-specific headers, envelopes or similar - this is mostly important
only if you're using SOAP XML as for JSON requests/responses or SIO responses,
the raw data is already what a service deals with, there are no envelopes of any sort.

Put a server into DEBUG mode to find out what the actual raw data is.

Configuration       One in how many invocations should be stored as a sample
                    request/response pair. Using 0 disables the feature
                    but doesn't delete the old sample, if any has been 
                    stored.
