Security
========

Transport-level security is service-independent
-----------------------------------------------

As a service developer, you usually don't need to be concerned with how the service
has been secured. 

Administrators use 
:doc:`HTTP Basic Auth <../web-admin/security/basic-auth>`,
:doc:`technical accounts <../web-admin/security/tech-account>`
or
:doc:`WS-Security <../web-admin/security/ws-security>` to make sure only permitted applications have access
to a service and when you're authoring a service which you know will be using
one of the three methods of securing the transport layer, you can simply assume 
that the authentication has been performed elsewhere by Zato itself, you don't need to
add any code yourself.

Naturally, if you'd like to use any other authentication scheme, one which Zato
doesn't support out of the box, your service is free to manually check access permissions,
Zato won't interfere with it in any way.

General recommendations
-----------------------

From a security-concious programmer's point of view, Zato is essentially a server
that accepts input from potentially hostile sources and transforms it into an output
of some sort. 

As such, despite its not being a typical web application like Django,
many of general recommendations regarding the development of safe applications
still apply. For instance, studying and implementing the applicable recommendations
presentented by `OWASP <https://owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>`_ will certainly
go a long way in making sure the services you develop stay safe.
