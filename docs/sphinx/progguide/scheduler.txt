Scheduler
=========

You can use :doc:`web admin <../web-admin/scheduler/main>`
and :doc:`the API </public-api/details/zato.scheduler.job>`
to specify a service be invoked once or at certain intervals. Jobs type supported
are one-time, interval-based and cron-style.

Among other things, the cluster's :doc:`singleton server </architecture/servers>`
runs a background thread whose sole purpose is to publish messages on 
:doc:`Redis </architecture/redis>` when a service should be invoked. The message
is picked up by on of servers and Zato invokes the service specified. 

It's worth emphasizing that publishing a message that a service should be run
and actually running it can be performed by two different servers, the process
is asynchronous. 

Because Zato won't wait for a previous execution of a service to
complete before the next one can be started, mutiple instances of a service 
triggered by a scheduler's job are able to run in parallel.

From the perspective of a service, being triggered by a job is like any other
access method. Programmatically, if you need to check if a service was
invoked through a job, you can consult its 
:ref:`channel <progguide-write-service-channel>`
and
:ref:`job_type <progguide-write-service-job_type>`
attributes. 
Note that are service hooks specific to scheduler jobs available.

.. note ::

   When creating a new job definition, you can specify extra data. In run-time,
   this will accessible to a service in its :ref:`request.payload <progguide-req-resp-req>`
   attribute.
