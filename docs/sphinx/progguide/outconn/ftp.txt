FTP outgoing connections
=========================

Overview
--------

Synchronously sends commands to a remote FTP server. Each service invocation
receives own connection which is closed after the service is done, 
connections are not kept around across multiple invocations.

Commands are sent in a synchronous manner but they don't block the current server thread.

The underlying client FTP library is `fs <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fs>`_.
