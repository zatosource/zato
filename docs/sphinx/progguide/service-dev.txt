Developing services
===================

From a programmer's point of view, a service is a Python class that subclasses
`zato.server.Service <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-server/src/zato/server/service/__init__.py>`_
and implements a handle(self) method.

Below is the simplest possible Zato service meant to illustrate the point of how
little coding is needed to write services. Granted, it doesn't do much useful,
but still can be :doc:`hot-deployed <../admin/guide/installing-services>` 
and while it's not possible to
:doc:`invoke <./invoking-services>`
it through
:doc:`channels <./channels>`,
it's still a valid service.


::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           pass
           
Programming conventions
-----------------------

* Services are developed in `Python 2.7.x <http://docs.python.org/2.7/>`_. No
  other Python versions can be used although adding support for Python 3.x is planned.

* You can't use the name 'zato', case-insensitively, anywhere. Any such names
  are reserved and can't be used. For instance, 'zato.sample', 'my:zato:data',
  'X-ZATO-SERVER' and 'ZatoReceiver' are all invalid.
  
  This applies to any Zato object you will use - services, connection names,
  channel names, any other.
  
* All input and output is always in UTF-8. Zato doesn't use nor support any other 
  encoding. Each request and response must always be in UTF-8. Being a subset
  of UTF-8, ASCII will also be accepted but you're adviced to alwys use UTF-8 anyway.
  Any other encodings, such as ISO-8859-1 or EBCDIC, are invalid.

* You are strongly encouraged to use the following header in each source code
  file you will keep services in. In fact, if you stumble upon any issues
  and need support you will be first asked that this header be added before any
  other advice can be given. Don't forget to set your code editor to write out
  files in UTF-8 too.
  
  This serves a couple of purposes:
  
  * Makes sure you actually use UTF-8 in your code
  * Lets you get prepared for Python 3.x
  * Ensures you use the same Python features :doc:`Zato's own services </public-api/intro>` use

  ::  
  
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
  
    from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals
    
* Each service invocation creates a new instance of the class the service is 
  represented as.
    
* Don't keep any state around if you want to use the :doc:`hot-deployment <../admin/guide/installing-services>` feature.
  Don't assign any values to classes the services are implemented in. Don't modify
  any module-global data. Use :doc:`Redis <../architecture/redis>` if you need to store data between
  invocations of a service. Otherwise it will still be possible to deploy a service
  but not without restarting a server.
  
* Don't start your own threads. Given Zato's architecture, there shouldn't really
  be any need for threads but if your use-case calls for it, 
  `please let the project know more <https://zato.io/support>`_ about why you need threads.
    
What a service can do
---------------------

Typically, a service will receive some input and produce an output. Both steps
are optional but usually at least one of them will be performed.

You can use 
:doc:`Simple IO (SIO)<./sio>`,
:doc:`JSON <./json>`,
:doc:`XML <./xml>`
or 
:doc:`any other data type <./other-formats>`
in your services.

Depending on the choices you make, it will be usually possible to make the very
same service, with no changes to the code, available across multiple 
:doc:`channels <./channels>`
- AMQP, JMS WebSphere MQ, Plain HTTP, SOAP and ZeroMQ

You can store data in 
Redis,
SQL databases
and specify your services be
periodically invoked through the scheduler.

A service can
:doc:`invoke other services <./invoking-services>`
as well as access resources outside a Zato environment.
The latter ones include
:doc:`AMQP <./outconn/amqp>`,
:doc:`JMS WebSphere MQ <./outconn/jms-wmq>`,
:doc:`Plain HTTP <./outconn/http>`,
:doc:`SOAP <./outconn/http>`,
:doc:`ZeroMQ <./outconn/zmq>`
and 
:doc:`FTP <./outconn/ftp>`.


Service API
-----------

This chapter will introduce the service API - a set of 
:ref:`attributes <progguide-write-service-attributes>`
and
:ref:`methods <progguide-write-service-methods>`
a service can make use of during processing of the messages.

Save the following code in service_api.py and :doc:`hot-deploy <../admin/guide/installing-services>` it - this will be
the servce that will be modified throughout the rest of the text.

::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           pass

.. _progguide-write-service-attributes:

Service attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

broker_client
`````````````

Services can publish messages on a :doc:`Redis </architecture/redis>` broker. 
How to use a broker client is explained in a 
:ref:`separate section <progguide-write-service-broker-client>`.

.. _progguide-write-service-channel:

channel
```````

Type of the channel (not its name) a service has been invoked through. 
Can be one of:

* 'amqp'
* 'http-soap'
* 'invoke'
* 'invoke-async'
* 'jms-wmq'
* 'scheduler'
* 'zmq'

The constants are defined in the 
`zato.common.CHANNEL <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_
class.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service
  
  class MyService(Service):
      def handle(self):
          self.logger.info('channel:[{}]'.format(self.channel))

::

  $ zato service invoke /opt/zato/server1 service-api.my-service
  
::

  INFO - channel:[invoke]
  

.. _progguide-write-service-cid:

cid
```

A correlation ID (CID) of this request. Each request is assigned a CID
which is 128 bits of random data, encoded as a string.

The string is prefixed with the letter 'K' to ensure that it always start with a character. There
is nothing special about the letter 'K', it just seemed a character that shouldn't
be easy to confuse with any other in the ASCII range. Don't assume the prefix 
will always be 'K', future Zato versions may make it configurable or change it
without prior notice.

Note that when 
:ref:`publishing <progguide-write-service-broker-client-publish>`
a 
`SERVICE.PUBLISH <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/broker_message.py>`_
message to more than one server, each server worker will receive a request
with the same CID.

CID has always 40 characters.

.. warning ::

  You must not use CIDs for any cryptographical purposes. There is no guarantee
  that a CID will be suitable for any particular crypto operation. CIDs should
  only be used to tell one request from another. Use
  `UUID4 <http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/uuid.html>`_ or a similar data
  type if you need truly random data.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service
  
  class MyService(Service):
      def handle(self):
          self.logger.info('cid:[{}]'.format(self.cid))

::

  $ zato service invoke /opt/zato/server1 service-api.my-service
  
::

  INFO - cid:[K280592090634247650299684980809341216327]

.. _progguide-write-service-data_format:
  
data_format
```````````

Each channel can optionally define that the data flowing in will be in
a particular data format. It can be one of:

* None
* 'json'
* 'xml'

The constants are defined in the 
`zato.common.DATA_FORMAT <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_
class.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service
  
  class MyService(Service):
      def handle(self):
          self.logger.info('data_format:[{}]'.format(self.data_format))

::

  $ zato service invoke /opt/zato/server1 service-api.my-service --data-format json
  
::

  INFO - data_format:[json]

.. _progguide-write-service-environ:
  
environ
```````

A dictionary of user-specific data that can be used for passing information
between :doc:`service hooks <./service-hooks>`. The service can store information in a
hook method and consult it in another one using the environ dictionary.

Zato will never use environ for its own purposes.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service
  
  class MyService(Service):
      def before_handle(self):
          self.environ['seen_before_invoke'] = True
      
      def handle(self):
          self.environ['seen_handle'] = True
          
      def after_handle(self):
          for name in('seen_before_invoke', 'seen_handle'):
              self.logger.info('{}:[{}]'.format(name, self.environ[name]))

Note that it will be available as a non-None value only in the 
:ref:`finalize_handle <progguide-write-service-finalize_handle>` service hook.

:ref:`invocation_time <progguide-write-service-invocation_time>` and
handle_return_time are used to compute the values of

      def handle(self):
          self.logger.info('impl_name:[{}]'.format(self.impl_name))

::

  $ zato service invoke /opt/zato/server1 service-api.my-service
  
::

  INFO - impl_name:[service_api.MyService]

.. _progguide-write-service-invocation_time:

invocation_time
```````````````

A `datetime.datetime <http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects>`_
object representing the time a service has been invoked at. Always in UTC.

invocation_time and
:ref:`handle_return_time <progguide-write-service-handle_return_time>` are used to compute the values of 
:ref:`processing_time <progguide-write-service-processing_time>`
and
:ref:`processing_time_raw <progguide-write-service-processing_time_raw>`.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service

      def handle(self):
          self.logger.info('invocation_time:[{}]'.format(self.invocation_time))

::

  $ zato service invoke /opt/zato/server1 service-api.my-service
  
::

  INFO - invocation_time:[2013-02-17 17:47:01.045913]

.. _progguide-write-service-job_type:

job_type
````````

If a service has been :doc:`invoked through a scheduler's job <./scheduler>`, type of the job
it was. None if the scheduler wasn't used. Can be one of:

* None
* 'one_time'
* 'interval_based'
* 'cron_style'

The constants are defined in the 
`zato.common.SCHEDULER_JOB_TYPE class <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_.

  INFO - job_type:[None]
  
kvdb
````

An object which lets one use :doc:`Redis, Zato's key/value database (KVDB) <../architecture/redis>`.
The underlying `redis-py connection <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_
is available as self.kvdb.conn.

::

  from zato.common import KVDB

  class MyService(Service):
      def handle(self):
          key = '{}{}'.format(KVDB.SERVICE_USAGE, self.name)
          usage = self.kvdb.conn.get(key)

::

  INFO - service-api.my-service was invoked 16 time(s)

.. _progguide-write-service-logger:

logger
``````

A logger, instance of
`zato.server.log.ZatoLogger <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-server/src/zato/server/log.py>`_, 
used for writing messages out to server logs.
This is a thin wrapper around `Python's logging.Logger <http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html>`_
which lets one use a 'cid' argument in addition to what is ordinarily available
when using a standard logger. This allows to use a 'cid' parameter in server logs.

Observe how the log output contains the CID now:

::

  %(asctime)s - %(cid)s - %(message)s

::

  from zato.server.service import Service
  
  class MyService(Service):
      def handle(self):
          self.logger.info('Hello!', cid=self.cid)

::

  $ zato service invoke /opt/zato/server1 service-api.my-service

An object through which one can access 
:doc:`Zato's Operational Database (ODB) </architecture/sql-odb>`.
An `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.org>`_ session object,
used to issue queries, is available as .session() - note that it always needs to be 
closed manually hence the use of the
`closing <http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.closing>`_
context manager in the example below.

::

.. _progguide-write-service-wsgi_environ:
  
wsgi_environ
````````````
Zato's HTTP server is a 
`WSGI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface>`_
one. If a service has been invoked through HTTP, wsgi_environ will be a dictionary of WSGI data.

The dictionary under zato.http.response.headers must not be used directly to define
what HTTP response headers a service will return. Use 
:ref:`response.headers <progguide-req-resp-resp>` instead.

Note that the example below assumes the service has been mounted at /service-api.my-service
through a plain HTTP channel,
otherwise, had :doc:`zato service invoke <../admin/cli/service-invoke>` been used
as an access method,  wsgi_environ would've been empty.

::

Method executed after :ref:`handle <progguide-write-service-handle>` and other service
hooks have completed. Explained further in the :doc:`chapter on service hooks <./service-hooks>`.

.. _progguide-write-service-get_name:

get_name

.. py:staticmethod:: get_name()

A static method that should be implemented to return
:ref:`service names <progguide-write-service-name>` other than what Zato
automatically generates.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service
  
  class MyService(Service):
      def handle(self):

.. _progguide-write-service-handle:
  
handle
``````

.. py:method:: handle()

The only method a service must implement. The central place where most of the
message processing will take place. Each time a channel accepts a message,
a new instance of the service class will be created and its handle method will
be called. 

A service is fully initialized and ready to process the request at the time
handle is being invoked.

Request and response objects are documented in 
:doc:`their own chapter <./request-response>`.

.. _progguide-write-service-invoke:

invoke
``````
.. py:method:: invoke(name[, payload='', channel=CHANNEL.INVOKE, data_format=None, transport=None, serialize=False, as_bunch=False])

  Synchronously invokes a service by its :ref:`name <progguide-write-service-name>`. The service
  is invoked in the same operating system's process and thread the current service
  is in. This is simply a standard invocation of another method so any exceptions
  raised in the service being invoked will propagate to the calling one.
  
  Other than consulting the 
  :ref:`channel <progguide-write-service-channel>`
  attribute, from the point of view of the service which is invoked, there is no way to
  discern that it's not being invoked through a regular channel created in the
  :doc:`web admin <../web-admin/intro>` or via :doc:`Zato's public API </public-api/intro>`.
  
  A `ZatoException <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_ will be raised if a service attempts to invoke itself.

translate
`````````
.. py:method:: translate(system1, key1, value1, system2, key2[, default=''])

   If there are two or more systems using different data dictionaries, it is desirable
   to be able to translate the dictionary values. 
   
   For instance, 
   if a CRM stores country codes as three-letter
   `ISO 3166-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>`_ codes whereas 
   a billing system a service connects to uses numeric codes, it can be said that,
   for Australia, there is a translation from CRM/COUNTRY_CODE/AUS
   to BILLING/COUNTRY_CODE with the result of 036. 
   
   The method can be used to translate values between such dictionaries.

.. _progguide-write-service-broker-client:

Publish/subscribe broker client
-------------------------------

Each service can asynchronously publish messages to one or more services on
servers running in the same cluster the publishing service is in.

A message needs to be a dictionary of metadata whose only required key is 'action'
which must point to a Zato service you want to invoke using constants
from the 
`zato.common.broker_message <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/feature/service-tests/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/broker_message.py>`_
module.

If you want to publish or send messages to all workers that contain your own services,
the action must be SERVICE.PUBLISH, this which will in turn publish the message to Zato's 
:doc:`zato.service.invoke </public-api/details/zato.service.invoke>` service 
which will next invoke the service of your choice by its 
:ref:`name <progguide-write-service-name>`.

.. note ::

  Publishing of messages to your own services is even simpler if you
  use the :ref:`invoke_async <progguide-write-service-invoke_async>`
  method.

.. _progguide-write-service-broker-client-publish:

Publishing a message to all servers (1:N)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All workers of all servers in a cluster will receive a message, including the one which
is publishing the message. 

It's possible that no subscriber will receive the message at all in a highly unlike
case when there's only one server with one worker in a cluster.
If the worker publishes a message - without the knowledge that it should be its
own sole recipient - and next goes down for any reason before the message
could be delivered - the message will be lost.

the cluster consisted of two servers, each running one worker.

Exactly one worker among all servers in a cluster will receive a message, possibly

Redis will store the message for a configurable amount of time under a key

it will expire. By default, expiration time is 15 seconds and can be specified when
sending the message.
