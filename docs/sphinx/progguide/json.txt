JSON
====

Overview
--------

As with :doc:`XML <./xml>`, it's most convenient to use :doc:`Simple IO (SIO) <./sio>`
to accept or return JSON in your services but if that's not an option using
JSON directly is still a piece of cake.

For starters, let's save the code below in a json_example.py file and
:doc:`hot-deploy <../admin/guide/installing-services>` it. This will be the service we'll be modifying in this chapter.

A channel through which it will be exposed to the outside world will also be needed.
Note the channel's data format is JSON. 

::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           pass

Accessing request elements
--------------------------

* 

   The JSON document, already parsed, is available in self.request.payload
   and its elements can be accessed using the dictionary notation.
   
   ::
   
      from zato.server.service import Service
      
      class MyService(Service):
          def handle(self):
              cust_id = self.request.payload['cust']['details']['id']
              self.logger.info('cust_id:[{}]'.format(cust_id))
              
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      $ curl localhost:17010/json-example.my-service -d '{"cust": {"details": {"id":1}}}'
      
   ::
   
      INFO - cust_id:[1]
      
*

   The request can be converted to a `Bunch <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bunch>`_
   instance so it's more convenient to reference the elements.
  
   ::
   
      # Bunch
      from bunch import bunchify 
      
      # Zato
      from zato.server.service import Service
      
      class MyService(Service):
          def handle(self):
              payload = bunchify(self.request.payload)
              self.logger.info('cust_id:[{}]'.format(payload.cust.details.id))
        
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      $ curl localhost:17010/json-example.my-service -d '{"cust": {"details": {"id":1}}}'
      
   ::
   
      INFO - cust_id:[1]
      
*
   The original JSON document, before it was parsed by Zato, is still available
   as self.request.raw_request. 
   
   Note that if you want to parse it yourself you will most
   likely want to make sure the channel a service is available through doesn't
   have its data format set to JSON. Otherwise Zato would parse the request 
   superfluously.
   
   ::
   
      from zato.server.service import Service
      
      class MyService(Service):
          def handle(self):
              self.logger.info('JSON:[{}]'.format(self.request.raw_request))
              
   .. code-block:: xml
   
      $ curl localhost:17010/json-example.my-service -d '{"cust": {"details": {"id":1}}}'
      
   ::
   
      INFO - JSON:[{"cust": {"details": {"id":1}}}]

Producing response
------------------

*

   You just need to return a JSON document as a string. It doesn't matter how it's
   created as long as self.response.payload is assigned a JSON string. Hence all
   the examples below are equivalent.
   
   ::
   
      from zato.server.service import Service
      
      class MyService(Service):
          def handle(self):
              self.response.payload = '{"customer_name":"Max Derkov"}'
              
   ::
   
      # stdlib
      from json import dumps
      
      # Zato
      from zato.server.service import Service
      
      class MyService(Service):
          def handle(self):
              self.response.payload = dumps({'customer_name':'Max Derkov'})
              
   ::
              
      # bunch
      from bunch import Bunch
      
      # Zato
      from zato.server.service import Service
      
      class MyService(Service):
          def handle(self):
              customer = Bunch()
              customer.customer = 'Max Derkov'
              self.response.payload = customer.toJSON()

              
   .. code-block:: xml
   
      $ curl localhost:17010/json-example.my-service -d ''
      {"customer_name":"Max Derkov"}
      

Simple IO (SIO)
---------------

.. note ::

   Consider using :doc:`SIO <./sio>` if you're developing a new application or its
   existing data model allows you to, SIO is even more easier to work with.
