Request and response objects
============================

Overview
--------



:ref:`Request <progguide-req-resp-req>`
and
:ref:`response <progguide-req-resp-resp>`
objects encapsulate information regarding the data a service
receives and produces. Both objects will always exist for each service invocation
but their payload can be empty, it's perfectly fine for a service not to accept
any input data nor to create output either.

There are also other complementing
:ref:`attributes <progguide-write-service-attributes>`
and
:ref:`methods <progguide-write-service-methods>`
a service has access to.

Save the following code in req_resp.py and :doc:`hot-deploy <../admin/guide/installing-services>` 
it - this will be the servce that will be modified later in the chapter. 

You'll also need to create a new plain HTTP channel so that the service can be easily accessed
through `curl <http://curl.haxx.se>`_.

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):

Request
-------

An instance of 
`zato.server.service.Request <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-server/src/zato/server/service/__init__.py>`_
class, each service's self.request provides access to several interesting
attributes regarding the input data.

.. note ::

    As an aid during development and debugging, a service can log its input
    using the
    :ref:`log_input <progguide-write-service-log_input>`
    method.

input        :doc:`SIO <./sio>` A :doc:`Simple IO <./sio>` payload object which allows
                                to directly address request elements regardless
                                of the data format. Will be behave like an empty
                                dictionary if the service doesn't use SIO.
                                
raw_request  string             Represents the request message exactly as it was received
                                by Zato, prior to having been parsed, if at all. 
                                
                                Always available regardless of the data format
                                and whether :doc:`SIO <./sio>` was used or not.
                                
                                raw_request will be an empty string if there was
                                no input data at all.
                                
payload      (depends)          If data_format is JSON and channel is a plain HTTP one,
                                the incoming JSON document as a Python dictionary.

                                If data_format is XML and channel is a plain HTTP one,
                                the root element of the document, an instance of 
                                `lxml.objectify.ObjectifiedElement <http://lxml.de/objectify.html>`_
                               
                                If data_format is XML and channel is a SOAP one,
                                first child of /soapenv:Envelope/soapenv:Body returned 
                                as an instance of 
                                `lxml.objectify.ObjectifiedElement <http://lxml.de/objectify.html>`_
                                
                                In all other cases, in particular - when using
                                :doc:`other data formats <./other-formats>` - 
                                this will be equal to raw_request.

    Looking for HTTP request headers? They're part of the 
    :ref:`WSGI environment <progguide-write-service-wsgi_environ>` a service receives.

Response
--------

An instance of 
`zato.server.service.Response <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-server/src/zato/server/service/__init__.py>`_
class, self.response attribute of each service instance influences what the application
invoking a service will receive.

payload          A service can assign output parameters directly to payload
                 if :doc:`SIO <./sio>` is used.
               
                 In any other case, payload must be assigned a string containing
                 the response.
               
result           Defaults to ZATO_OK and must be either ZATO_OK or ZATO_ERROR from 
                 `zato.common <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_.
                 If the latter, an exception will be raised and signalled to the 
                 calling invocation in a transport-specific way, e.g. using
                 a Fault message for SOAP channels. A proper status_code will
                 be returned too.
result_details   If result is ZATO_ERROR, any details the client application should receive.
content_type     HTTP only. Value of the Content-Type header to return. Sane
                 defaults are used:
               
                 * 'application/json' for JSON channels
                 * 'application/xml' for Plain HTTP channels with XML data format
                 * 'application/xml' for SOAP 1.1
                 * 'application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8' for SOAP 1.2
               
headers          HTTP only. A dictionary of headers you'd like for the service to return.
status_code      HTTP only. Status code a service returns. Must be one of the responses
                 `httplib <http://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html>`_
                 defines. Defaults to httplib.OK
============== = ==============================================================================================

.. note ::

    As an aid during development and debugging, a service can log its output
    using the
    :ref:`log_output <progguide-write-service-log_output>`
    method.
    
Setting HTTP response headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example of how one can affect the exact HTTP headers a service
will return.

You can also visit http://localhost:17010/req-resp.my-service in your browser.	

::

    # stdlib
    import httplib

    # Zato
    from zato.server.service import Service

    class MyService(Service):

        def handle(self):
            self.log_input()
            self.response.status_code = httplib.OK # Same as default
            self.response.payload = 'welcome,to,Zato'
            self.response.content_type = 'text/csv'
            self.response.headers['X-Welcome'] = 'Happy coding! :-)'
            self.response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=info.csv'

::

  $ curl localhost:17010/req-resp.my-service
  
.. code-block:: text
    :emphasize-lines: 9,14,15,16,20

    $ curl -v localhost:17010/req-resp.my-service
