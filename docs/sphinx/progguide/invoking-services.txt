Invoking other services
=======================

.. note ::
    This chapter documents how other services running in a Zato cluster can be invoked.
    Visit :doc:`here <./outconn/overview>` for information how to establish connections to external
    services and resources.
    
Choosing a mode of invocation
=============================

Services can be invoked 
:ref:`synchronously <progguide-write-service-invoke>`
or in an 
:ref:`asynchronous manner <progguide-write-service-invoke_async>`
so that you
can choose whether the invoking service is blocked waiting for the response
or if the other service should be run in background. 

Note that for the latter,
you won't receive a response directly, instead, when invoking another service asynchronously
you are given a 
:ref:`CID <progguide-write-service-cid>` the service being invoked will also receive so that
its response, if any, can be correlated later on, using other Zato mechanisms, specific to your
application.

Regardless of the invocation method, there is no difference in how requests are passed
in.

If a service is being run programmatically its 
:ref:`channel attribute <progguide-write-service-channel>` 
will be 'invoke' or 'invoke-async' depending on the invocation style.

A service cannot invoke itself synchronously. It's possible for a service to
invoke itself asynchronously but doing so will create an infinite loop.

How to pass a request to another service
========================================

* 

    Passing a request is most convenient if another service uses :doc:`Simple IO (SIO) <./sio>`,
    in such cases it's possible to use a plain Python dictionary as input data.
    
    .. note ::

      Zato uses SIO in its own services and this is how they can be invoked.
    
    ::

        from zato.server.service import Service

        class MyService(Service):
            def handle(self):
            
                # A regular dictionary will do when invoking an SIO service
                input_data = {'cluster_id': 1}
                
                response = self.invoke('zato.security.get-list', input_data, as_bunch=True)
                for item in response.zato_security_get_list_response:
                    self.logger.info(item.name)


* Use the 'data_format' parameter if a service expects the incoming data to be in a particular
  data format, such as JSON or XML.
  
  ::

    # stdlib
    from json import dumps

    # Zato
    from zato.common import DATA_FORMAT
    from zato.server.service import Service

    class MyService(Service):
        def handle(self):
        
            input_data = {'customer_id': 123, 'phone_no': '123-456-789'}
            input_data = dumps(input_data) # Convert to JSON
            
            service_name = 'invoking.my-service2'
            self.invoke(service_name, input_data, data_format=DATA_FORMAT.JSON)
            
            self.logger.info(response)

    class MyService2(Service):
        def handle(self):
        
            # Note how the payload is already a Python dictionary
            # and doesn't need to be parsed manually
            self.logger.info(self.request.payload['customer_id'])
      
* Same thing but done asynchronously:
  
  ::
  
    # stdlib
    from json import dumps

    # Zato
    from zato.common import DATA_FORMAT
    from zato.server.service import Service

    class MyService(Service):
        def handle(self):

            input_data = {'customer_id': 123, 'phone_no': '123-456-789'}
            input_data = dumps(input_data) # Convert to JSON

            service_name = 'invoking.my-service2'
            self.invoke_async(service_name, input_data, data_format=DATA_FORMAT.JSON)

            self.logger.info(response)

    class MyService2(Service):
        def handle(self):

            # Note how the payload is already a Python dictionary
            # and doesn't need to be parsed manually
            self.logger.info(self.request.payload['customer_id'])
      
Reading responses
=================

* SIO services will produce dictionaries as their responses and you can choose to
  use them directly or to convert a response to a Bunch in order to use the
  dot-notation when accessing the response's elements. Thus, the examples below
  are equivalent.
  
  ::
  
    from zato.server.service import Service

    class MyService(Service):
        def handle(self):
            response = self.invoke('invoking.my-service2')
            self.logger.info(response['my_response_elem']['cust_name'])

    class MyService2(Service):
        class SimpleIO:
            input_required = ('cust_id',)
            output_required = ('cust_name',)
            response_elem = 'my_response_elem'
            
        def handle(self):
            self.response.payload.cust_name = 'Alexis Abramov'
            
  ::
  
    from zato.server.service import Service

    class MyService(Service):
        def handle(self):
            response = self.invoke('invoking.my-service2', as_bunch=True)
            self.logger.info(response.my_response_elem.cust_name)

    class MyService2(Service):
        class SimpleIO:
            input_required = ('cust_id',)
            output_required = ('cust_name',)
            response_elem = 'my_response_elem'
            
        def handle(self):
            self.response.payload.cust_name = 'Alexis Abramov'
            
* Services that don't use SIO will create string responses that will have to be
  parsed manually. 
  
  ::
  
    # stdlib
    from json import dumps, loads

    # Zato
    from zato.server.service import Service

    class MyService(Service):
        def handle(self):
            response = self.invoke('invoking.my-service2')
            response = loads(response) # Convert the string response to a JSON doc
            self.logger.info(response['cust_name'])

    class MyService2(Service):
        def handle(self):
            cust_data = {'cust_name': 'Alexis Abramov'}
            self.response.payload = dumps(cust_data)
            
* When invoking a service asynchronously you don't know when its response will be
  produced nor what server the service will be executed on even though on the source-code
  level they both may be defined in the very same Python module as in the example
  below. 
  
  Hence, the response from
  an asynchronous invocation is the :ref:`CID <progguide-write-service-cid>` 
  the service which is being invoked will receive. 
  
  You can use the CID returned
  to correlate asynchronous responses when they are available - how it's performed
  is up to your application.
  
  ::
  
    from zato.server.service import Service

    class MyService(Service):
        def handle(self):
            cid = self.invoke_async('invoking.my-service2')
            self.logger.info('Got CID {}'.format(cid))

    class MyService2(Service):
        def handle(self):
            self.logger.info('My CID is {}'.format(self.cid))
            
  ::
  
    INFO - Got CID K117816978965978292208766150986347804459
    INFO - My CID is K117816978965978292208766150986347804459
