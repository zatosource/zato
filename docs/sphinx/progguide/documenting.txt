Documenting
===========

It goes without saying that each service you develop needs to have decent
documentation and if you have no prior documentation standard you can use Zato's
own public service API as a starting point.

* A documentation should begin with a short chapter explaining 
  :doc:`what the services are in the first place</public-api/intro>`
  - if confronted with several sources of information at the
  same time your users should in the first glance be able to tell whether your docs
  are what they need in a given situation or not.

* You need a table of contents (TOC) 
  :ref:`table of contents <index-public-api-toc>`
  so it's possible to quickly locate which service group or domain a service one
  needs to find belongs to. Groups should be sorted alphabetically in ascending order.
   
* A link from a TOC should point to a general 
  :doc:`overview of a given service group</public-api/details/zato.security.basic-auth>`
  with a list of links to particular services, sorted alphabetically in ascending order. 
  
* A 
  :doc:`chapter on each service </public-api/details/zato.security.basic-auth.create>`
  should contain the following:
  
  * A brief description of the service
  * A True/False flag regarding whether the service returns a list of objects
  * SOAP and JSON URLs, if a service is to be invoked under either
  * A link to a WSDL document if SOAP should used
  * Lists of request and responses parameters, each containing:
    
    * Name of the parameter
    * Its datatype
    * Whether the parameter is optional or not
    * Any notes helping the user in understanding what the parameter is for
    
  * SOAP and JSON usage examples, if either is used - these should use values that
    are correct in the formal sense. 
    
    For instance, they can be taken from a DEV
    environment where customer IDs are invalid yet they conform to a given system's
    format of such identifiers. 
    
    The point being, usage examples are something your users will want to lean on 
    so they should be as close to real messages as it is possible.
