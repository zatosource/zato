Synchronous and asynchronous message flow
=========================================

In order to maximize the throughput of a Zato cluster and indeed, of the whole
environment Zato is a part of, it's usually desirable to consider whether the procesess,
even synchronous ones, shouldn't be in fact implemented in an asynchronous, non-blocking,
fashion.

Consider the simple synchronous process below. A client application is asking for
a customer's credit score. 

The second and subsequent requests can be very
fast however the initial one can take a considerable amount of time because the 
backend will have to perform the initial calculation, possibly consulting several
external applications along.

Once the initial score is obtained, it can be assigned a validity time and stored for 
a later use.

Clearly the high-level process is a synchronous one yet it can be implemented in two different
ways:

* Invoking Zato and waiting for the response, blocking the client application, Zato and backend along.

  This is a blocking way. Every part involved will wait for the credit score to be 
  calculated. From Zato's point of view, given that it's implemented on top of 
  :doc:`an asynchronous gunicorn framework <../../architecture/servers>`, 
  the fact that it needs to wait is to some extent 
  acceptable. For other parts, however, this may mean a performance drop if,
  for instance, several minutes will be needed to obtain the credit score.


* Submitting the request to be notified when the result is ready and fetching the
  result after it's known the score is ready.

  Client application receives a correlation ID assigned to the request by Zato. The backend application
  receives it as well and when the credit score is ready, it notifies Zato, which
  forwards the message to the client. Only then the latter fetches the score - this can
  be done by correlation or customer ID.
  
  Except for backend, which does the heavy work in either scenario, none of the components is blocked, 
  no resources are wasted unnecessarily. Note that the individual services Zato exposes
  to both sides can be in fact synchronous, however the approach is an asynchronous one.
