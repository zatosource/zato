Logging
=======

self.logger
-----------

Each service has access to the :ref:`self.logger <progguide-write-service-logger>` 
object which is an instance of a Python stdlib's `logging.Logger class 
<http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html#logger-objects>`_.

::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
           
       def handle(self):
           self.logger.info('handle called')
           
The message will be written to the logs though where to exactly depends on 
:doc:`how a server has been configured by administrators <../admin/guide/install-config/config-server>` - by default
messages are written to local log files but the exact location or locations
can be set to anything Python's logging library supports, including syslog, e-mail
or ZeroMQ sockets.

Additionally, each service offers the 
:ref:`log_input <progguide-write-service-log_input>`
and
:ref:`log_output <progguide-write-service-log_output>`
convenience methods to simplify the task of logging the IO.

SQL
---

As a special aid during development, one can exploit the fact that 
`SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_, the toolkit Zato uses for connecting
to SQL databases, allows one to echo all the statements issued if one passes an 'extra=True'
flag when the connection is established.

In practical terms, it means that adding line to a server.conf such as 

.. code-block:: ini

   [odb]
   extra=echo=True

will make SQLAlchemy output all the SQL queries to server logs on the DEBUG level.
