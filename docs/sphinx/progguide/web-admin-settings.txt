Making sure you work on the right environment
=============================================

A single 
:doc:`web admin </architecture/web-admin>`
instance can be used to handle multiple environments,
such as production, tests and development, and to help you with differentiating
which environment you currently work with, you can assign 
(click :doc:`'My settings' <../web-admin/settings/main>` in the top-right corner) a color to each cluster
so that, for instance, a production cluster will be in yellow while development
will use green.

If you pick any, a horizontal bar of that color will be prominently displayed
to make sure you remeber which environment you currently work with. Each web admin
user has their own set of colors.
