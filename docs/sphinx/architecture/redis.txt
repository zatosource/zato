Redis key/value database (KVDB) is used by servers to store data that is 
of highly dynamic od volatile nature. Each cluster needs a KVDB and each KVDB
belongs to a single cluster only, Redis cannot be shared between clusters.

The data stored in Redis can be:

- :ref:`arch-redis-stats`
- :ref:`arch-redis-sample-req-resp`
- :ref:`arch-redis-slow-resp`
- :ref:`arch-redis-dist-lock`
- :ref:`arch-redis-broker`
- :ref:`arch-redis-data-dict`

.. _arch-redis-stats:

Statistics
----------

Zato servers collect service statistics under keys starting with the 'zato:stats:'
prefix, such as 'zato:stats:service:usage:zato.definition.amqp.GetByID' or
'zato:stats:service:time:aggr-by-minute:zato.stats.summary.CreateSummaryByDay:2013:02:10:22:10'.

Statistics under keys starting with 'zato:stats:service:time:raw-by-minute' contain
information regarding the execution of each of the services run during a given minute.
Scheduler-initiated services will periodically aggregate raw data into high-order
structures, such as statistics concerning a given hour or a day. Raw data will
then be deleted.

.. _arch-redis-sample-req-resp:

Sample requests and responses
-----------------------------

It is possible for each service to store sample requests and responses in Redis.
This is meant to facilitate the process of answering a common question of how
a typical request/response pair for a given service might look like.

.. _arch-redis-slow-resp:

Slow responses
--------------

Services can be assigned a slow response threshold after exceeding of which,
top 100 slow responses of a given service along with their requests and additional
metadata will be stored in Redis.

.. _arch-redis-dist-lock:

Distributed locks
-----------------

Some processes taking place withing cluster need to be performed by one
of multiple processes or servers only. For instance, there are typically multiple
gunicorn workers supporting a Zato server and they all start up asynchronously.
Only one of them should be allowed to deploy services deployed on a server 
and Redis is used to implement a distributed lock for that purpose.

.. _arch-redis-broker:

Broker messages
---------------

Servers never communicate directly. If one server needs to inform one or more
servers of, for instance, a change in its configuration, a message in published
on Redis and other servers, subscribed on Redis channels, pick it up.

Likewise, a message the cluster's scheduler wants to send to one of the servers
will be published to Redis and a server will receive it asynchronously.

Connectors are the other part of a Zato cluster that use Redis. Message exchanging
using AMQP, WebSphere MQ and ZeroMQ is never performed directly between services
and external applications - services send messages to Redis, connectors pick
them up and send them over to queues. Conversly, when a connector receives a 
message on queue, the message is published on Redis and one of the server subscribed
receives it asynchronously.

.. _arch-redis-data-dict:

Data dictionaries
-----------------

Data dictionaries are a feature that allows one to easily map values between
applications. For instance, a CRM might use ISO 4217 currency names (US dollar is
USD) while an accounting application could use numerical values (US dollar is 840).
A data dictionary is a mapping between the two and it's stored in Redis for a quick retrieval.
