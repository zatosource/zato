Overview
--------

Servers are the central point of Zato. This is where :doc:`services <../progguide/service-dev>` are running,
where request issued by external applications arrive and where requests from
Zato to other systems originate from.

Each server is a part of exactly one cluster. There is no limit of how many
servers a cluster may contain.

Servers are implemented using `gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_ - this allows
Zato servers to be asynchronous, meaning they are very fast, light on resources
and able to accept large numbers of incoming HTTP connections.

There is no upper limit to the number of servers running in a single operating system
although how many servers there are will be typically limited by how many CPUs the are
(CPU_COUNT) and how many gunicorn workers will be started. For instance, if a server has 4 CPUs and you want
for each server to have 2 gunicorn workers, it will make most sense to have
between 2-4 servers (2 workers each) so that the total number of workers doesn't
exceed 2 * CPU_COUNT. Each worker is a separate OS process so adding more servers
or workers would make them compete for CPU too strenuously.

Singletons
----------

For each cluster, exactly one sever will be designated to a role of the singleton
server. This is be the sever that will be responsible for managing the tasks
that must not be run in more than one instance - 
:ref:`a cluster's scheduler <arch-servers-scheduler>` and :ref:`connectors <arch-servers-connectors>`.

When the first server in a cluster starts up, it is assigned the role of the singleton server,
and the server will periodically update its keep-alive flag in the :doc:`ODB <./sql-odb>`.
Other servers joining the cluster will each check if the singleton server is still alive
and if the keep-alive flag isn't updated in the expected interval, one of the other
servers will become the singleton. This is known as the process of migrating a singleton
server.

Load-balancer
-------------

In front of each cluster is a :doc:`high-availability load-balancer <./load-balancer>`, implemented
using an HAProxy instance running in a subprocces. The load-balancer makes sure
the incoming HTTP traffic is evenly distributed across all the servers in a cluster
while allowing the servers to join or leave the cluster without interrupting
the message flow.

Redis and SQL ODB
-----------------

Servers use :doc:`Redis <./redis>` and an :doc:`SQL Operational Database (ODB) <./sql-odb>`
for storing their configuration and statistics.

Redis is used as a message broker for exchanging information
between servers and between the scheduler and servers. Servers never communicate
directly, if it's needed for one server to send a message to one or more servers,
the message is published in Redis and other servers receive it from Redis. This
is an asynchronous processes. 

When the scheduler needs to invoke a service, it publishes a message
to Redis, the message is picked up by one of the cluster's servers and again,
there is no direct communication between the scheduler and servers.

Connectors use Redis too. If a service needs to send a message to AMQP, JMS WebSphere MQ
or ZeroMQ, or if external applications use this protocols to send messages to Zato,
they all are routed through Redis in an asynchronous manner. 

.. _arch-servers-scheduler:

Scheduler
---------

Each cluster has a scheduler which can be used to schedule services to be invoked
periodically. This can be used, for instance, to check for new files to process on FTP
each 15 minutes or in similar situations.

Scheduler jobs can be:

- one-time - for quick one-off jobs
- interval-based - for recurring tasks
- cron-style - similar to interval-based yet using `cron syntax <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_,
  this is meant to aid in migrating already existing tasks from cron to Zato

.. _arch-servers-connectors:


HTTP, FTP and SQL
-----------------

HTTP, FTP and SQL are protocols through which Zato services can connect to other
applications directly, in a synchronous fashion.

HTTP can be either plain HTTP or HTTPS and uses the `requests <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/>`_
library. Any messages can be exchanged, JSON, XML,
CSV or any other format although Zato has special and unique support for the first two
if you decide to use Zato's :doc:`Simple IO <../progguide/sio>` mechanism.

FTP should be understood as both FTP and FTPS. Note that Zato opens a new FTP
connection for each service invocation, for instance - you scheduled a job
to be run twice a minute, the job is to invoke a service which will fetch a file
from an FTP. In that scenario, the service will open and close a new FTP connection twice 
a minute.

Supported SQL databases are 
`Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html>`_
and
`PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org>`_.
Access to SQL resources is implemented using the `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.org>`_ library.

Connectors
----------

AMQP, JMS WebSphere MQ and ZeroMQ are protocols that Zato uses asynchronously
through cluster connectors. For that protocols, each channel and an outgoing connection
will start a new connector, e.g. if there are 3 AMQP channels and 2 ZeroMQ outgoing
connections defined, there will be 5 connectors started by the :ref:`singleton server <arch-servers-singletons>`.

Services and connectors communicate indirectly through Redis.

If a channel receives a new message, the message is taken off a queue,
published on Redis, one of the servers subscribed receives it and a service is invoked.

Conversly, if a service needs to put a message on a queue, the message is first
published to Redis, a connector pick it up and the message is sent to its destination.

Administrators
--------------

Zato administrators use :doc:`web admin <./web-admin>` and the :doc:`CLI </admin/cli/create-odb>`
to manage clusters.

Web admin is a graphical browser-based console used for configuring most aspects of a running
cluster. A single web admin instance can be used for connecting to more than one
cluster. Web admin uses :doc:`Zato's public API </public-api/intro>` for the management,
it never directly updates a cluster's state in the ODB.

The :doc:`command-line interface </admin/cli/create-odb>` is used to create,
start and stop servers running in a cluster - as a security measure, these commands
cannot be issued remotely through the web admin. CLI is also used for updating
cryptographical material of servers and returning
:doc:`information </admin/cli/info>`
:doc:`regarding servers </admin/cli/component-version>`
that isn't available otherwise.
